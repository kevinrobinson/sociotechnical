# Pushing back against tech solutionism
One of the core tensions in doing client work, or partnering with internal teams on ML work is that practioners often need to be building trust and demonstrating value in order to sustain the partnership.

This can make it particularly difficult to ask questions that open the possibility that the problem could be better served with other kinds of work, or different kinds of partnerships.

## Reframing towards problems
There's a lot of great strategies for setting expectations, and reframing projects to focus on problems, rather than the assumptions that stakeholders may have about the best solutions.

Consultants and designers commonly have to do this work, and these suggestions are adapted from *Themes: A Small Change to Product Roadmaps with Large Effects* ([Spool](https://articles.uie.com/themes/)).

> *Themes are a Promise to Solve Problems, Not Build Features*

> A typical roadmap feature might be a data export capability to Salesforce. Customers may have even asked for this feature, saying they’d buy a ton more licenses if the product made it easy to move the data.

> But with Bruce’s Themes, the product strategy team would research why customers want to move their data to Salesforce. How does it make their life easier? Might it be even better if the data could move in both directions? How up to date does the Salesforce data need to be? What happens after it gets into Salesforce? What’s the bigger problem that needs solving?

> That last question is quite interesting. By understanding how having the data exported to Salesforce contributes to solving a bigger problem, the team may uncover interesting alternative solutions. Maybe Salesforce is just an intermediate stop along the way to becoming something bigger? If so, maybe there’s functionality the team could add to the product (or even better, might already exist but is currently hard to find)?


## Suggesting other pathways
Adapted from *When the Implication Is Not to Design (Technology)* ([Baumer and Silberman 2011)](When the Implication Is Not to Design (Technology)), here are some questions that can help stakeholders consider these questions:

- Could the technology be replaced by an equally viable low-tech or non-technological approach to the situation?
- Does a technological intervention result in more trouble or harm than the situation it’s meant to address?
- Does a technology solve a computationally tractable transformation of a problem rather than the problem itself?

For client work, it can be helpful to partner with other organizations, so that you can continue to add value by providing an alternate (and perhaps even more cost-effective) path forward.
