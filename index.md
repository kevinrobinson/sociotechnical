# Fairness is a sociotechnical problem
Fairness in data science, machine learning, or any aspect of computer science is always challenging.  It involves balancing different stakeholders, translating between their vocabularies and perspectives, and finding ways to move forward that feels right to you and to everyone impacted by your work.

This makes the intake and discovery process in new projects particularly important.  It often involves coming into an unfamiliar domain and trying to understand it, while also building trust and confidence with your partners that your work can help them accomplish what they care about.


## If you are in a hurry
Most projects have limited time and budget.  But like distributed systems, cryptography algoriths, and authentication systems, fairness is often much more complicated than solving leetcode problems or running `pip install` and writing 3 lines of code :)

Each person and team needs to make their own tradeoffs.  But cutting corners on fairness can have the same kinds of severe unexpected consequences for a team as cutting corners on security.

## Learning more
Learning about fairness is often challenging because it involves asking questions about leaky abstractions, and considering tradeoffs that are far more complex than typical engineering work.  It's common for people to take months or years to deepen their understanding of fairness issues.

## Make a new friend!
These folks would love to take questions from data scientists trying to grow their work in fairness. They can help with things like:
- cutting through all the literature review
- recommending collaborators in a specific field
- asking questions and spotting red flags
