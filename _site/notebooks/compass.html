      <h1 id="pre-trial-detection">Pre-trial detection</h1>
<p>(needs reworking, and needs Lum et al. up front).</p>

<p>Well, you see… human-centered AI (<a href="http://www.jennwv.com/papers/intel-chapter.pdf">Vaughan and Wallach 2020</a>).</p>

<p>It’s hard to design (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376301#.XqgYt7sI0DI.twitter">Yang et al. 2019</a>).</p>

<p>And those pesky humans “do alter their behavior when the tool is deployed” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08035.pdf">De-Arteaga et al. 2020</a>).</p>

<p>Even the “existence of visualizations and the fact that the tools were publicly available led to cases of over-trust and misuse” (<a href="http://www.jennwv.com/papers/interp-ds.pdf">Kaur et al. 2020</a>).</p>

<p>And the humans were “less likely to adhere to the machine’s recommendation when the score displayed was an incorrect estimate of risk” (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kyk1067yk6a6yqp/Lessons_from_the_Deployment_of_an_Algorithmic_Tool_in_Child_Welfare.pdf?dl=0">Fogliato et al. 2020</a>).</p>

<p>Sometime the humans even talk to each other and develop a “general distrust in the existing system [that] contributes significantly to low comfort in algorithmic decision making” (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/files/accountability_final_balanced.pdf">Brown et al. 2019</a>).</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>But maybe just maybe none of that applies to pre-trial detention (aka COMPASS if you only speak dataset),  oops it is now 30 seconds later and I ran a search on the internet.  And a lot of people have written about pre-trial detention.</p>

<p>Some people even has the zany idea to write a paper called “What Do Criminal Justice Professionals Think About Risk Assessment at Pretrial?” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3168490">DeMichele et al. 2018</a>).  I mean listen to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We describe findings from surveys with [humans] in 30 jurisdictions about their perceptions and use of risk assessments in making pretrial release decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely not web scale but check what they determined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[the humans’] view and use of these tools is critical because there is substantial discretion in whether and how they implement recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And some other people have found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several prior studies find that [the humans are] affected by [other humans they talk to]  (Albonetti, 1986, 1987, 1991; Holleran, Beichner, &amp; Spohn, 2010; Miller &amp; Sloan, 1994).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait for it, in this survey they did convert it to numbers and I added some bold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, respondents were asked about the extent to which they agree with recommendations from the tool and how frequently they use it (Table 5). <strong>Virtually [zero humans] indicated that they “always” or “never” agreed with the PSA recommendation</strong>. Judges (63%) and pretrial staff (72%) were more likely to indicate they agreed with it “often.” Half of defenders and 38% of prosecutors indicated they agree with the recommendation “sometimes.” Nearly one in three prosecutors “rarely” agree with it. This is consistent with earlier results suggesting that judges and pretrial staff saw fewer weaknesses in the DMF than prosecutors and defenders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, so like what if we put a smidge of the uncertainty from (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3168490">DeMichele et al. 2018</a>) into a tool?  Would the map seem so appealing if it were less abstracted from the territory?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Humans respond to this differently, and sometimes people have found that “[the humans making the computers] wanted much more information density than [the humans using the computers]” (<a href="https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/uncertainty-over-space/">Pearce 2020</a>).</p>

<p>Also this paper is also about pretrial detention, but instead of asking humans it asks simulated human computers on Mechanical Turk (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/19-fat.pdf">Green And Chen</a>).  But still kind of interesting, like, epistimelogically.</p>

<p>And here’s ML Cummings on automation bias to close us out, (<a href="https://hal.pratt.duke.edu/sites/hal.pratt.duke.edu/files/u13/Automation%20Bias%20in%20Intelligent%20Time%20Critical%20Decision%20Support%20Systems.pdf">2004</a>) style:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Automated decision aids are designed to reduce human error but actually can cause new errors in the operation of a system if not designed with human cognitive limitations in mind.</p>
