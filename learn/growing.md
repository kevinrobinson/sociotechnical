# Growing a culture for fairness
If you'd like more general guidelines and checklists for fairness in ML development:
- how to collaborate on ML framing and design ([People + AI Handbook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/))
- how to co-design with people impacted by your work ([Design Justice Principles](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles))
- how to audit datasets with datasheets ([research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf))
- describing ML limitations with model cards ([example](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/object-detection), [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf))
- fairness questions throughout the ML lifecycle ([see appendix of research paper](http://www.jennwv.com/papers/checklists.pdf))
